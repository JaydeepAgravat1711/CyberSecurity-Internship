# Password Strength Analysis Summary

## Overview
This summary presents the results of testing three different passwords to assess their strength and understand how character variety and length impact security.

## Tested Passwords and Results
1. **Password:** `1234`  
   - **Score:** 4%  
   - **Complexity:** Very Weak  
   - **Remarks:** Too short, only numeric, easy to guess.
