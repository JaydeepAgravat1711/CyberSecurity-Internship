# Task 6 - Password Strength Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this task was to evaluate the strength of different passwords using an online password strength checker. The aim was to understand the factors that make passwords weak or strong and to emphasize the importance of secure password practices.

## Steps Performed
1. Chose three passwords of varying complexity:
   - Simple numeric password
   - Simple lowercase password
   - Strong mixed-character password
2. Tested each password using the PasswordMeter tool (https://passwordmeter.com).
3. Captured screenshots showing the score and complexity.
4. Analyzed results and compared them against recommended password security practices.

## Tools Used
- PasswordMeter (Online Password Strength Checker)
- Screenshot tool for result documentation

## Conclusion
- Short and simple passwords are highly insecure and vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
- Strong passwords include a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols, with a length of at least 8 characters.
- Following these best practices significantly improves password security and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
